# Testing Projects Repository

This repository contains three separate projects designed to unit testing using Jasmine:

- **Angular app:** located in the `angular-testing-app` folder.
- **Node.js app:** located in the `node-testing-app` folder.
- **Native JavaScript files:** located in the `native js` folder.

---

## Projects Overview

### 1. Angular App (`angular-testing-app`)

This Angular project includes a component named `likes` which students should write unit tests for using Jasmine.

### 2. Node.js App (`node-testing-app`)

This Node.js project exposes two APIs. Students should write tests using Jasmine and Supertest for the API testing details in the file `API.spec.js`.

### 3. Native JavaScript (`native js`)

This folder contains vanilla JavaScript file, including a `shoppingCart` class that students are expected to write Jasmine tests for. Testing details are in `shoppingCart.spec.js` file.

## What to Test

- **Angular app:** Unit test the functionality and behavior of the `likes` component.
- **Node.js app:** Unit test the two API routes in `API.spec.js`. Validate that endpoints behave correctly under various conditions.
- **Native JS:** Write tests for the `shoppingCart` class (adding, calculating totals and checkout process).

Happy testing! Use Jasmine's features to write clear, maintainable tests and ensure code reliability.
